The i2c_master core consists of three files:

- i2c_master_top        -- top level
- i2c_master_byte_ctrl  -- byte controller
- i2c_master_bit_ctrl   -- bit controller

VHDL needs to be compiled in order. The files are listed 
above in descending order.

I2C.VHD and tst_ds1621.vhd are not supported anymore.
They remain mostly for historical purposes, altough they
might prove usefull.
